k-nearest:
    idea--> predict the label of a data by:
            looking at the 'k' closest labeled data points

Scikit-learn and predict:
- all ML models implemented as Python classes
    - algorithms for learning and predicting
    - store the info learned from the data
- training a model on the data = 'fitting' a model to the data
    -.fit() method
- to predict the labels of new data: .predict() method
no missing values
valores continuos

Measuring model performance
- fraction of correct predictions / cant of data points
- split data set: training and test
